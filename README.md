# BMIN503 Final Project: Predicting ICU length of stay among patients with alcohol-associated liver disease

*Overview*

Hello! This project aims to predict the ICU length of stay for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease by applying and comparing several supervised machine learning algorithms: linear regression models, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. This study will use the Medical Information for Intensive Care (MIMIC) -IV database. I met with Dr. Serper, who contributed domain expertise from her clinical experience as a gastroenterologist, and consulted Dr. Min regarding analytic and machine learning approaches. <br /><br />
